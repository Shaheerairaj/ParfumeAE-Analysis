       "    \"Versace Pour Homme is a classy fresh floral fragrance that gets the job done any day of the week. In the opening I get perfect combo of citrus and floral notes that give this cologne it's signature smell. The woody and musky notes become more apparent on the dry down but the freshness remains. When I first smelled this I wasn't won over but after a few wears I loved it. It's a super safe dumb reach fragrance that won't offend anyone. Performance could be better but for the price you can get this for at discounters, it is a steal. A staple freshie that belongs in everyone's fragrance collection.\",\n",

It can be worn any time of year and is office safe as long as you don't go too heavy. 1 spray to the chest/neck and one to the wrist is all you need. If you do more it's no longer office safe. I have a 2019 batch that I bought not long ago from a gray seller. It's a little pricey but you can smell the quality. You get what you pay for in most cases and this satisfies its high price tag.
